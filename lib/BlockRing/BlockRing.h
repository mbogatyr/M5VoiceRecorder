// without gaps. The firmware keeps the queue full, so of all queued blocks
// the two most recent are still being written and everything older is
// complete. The ring counts how many blocks have been queued and uses that
// count to hand out the complete blocks one by one, in order.

// Taken from M5SpectrumAnalyzer; there it stitched blocks into an FFT
// window, here every block is read once, as it completes.
